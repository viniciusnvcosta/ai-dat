# ai-dat

***AI Deployment as Template***

A quality template to deploy containerized AI projects. 🏗️

## Important
This project is thoroughly based on `arturhenrique`'s [cookiecutter-fastapi](https://github.com/arthurhenrique/cookiecutter-fastapi) and `mateuscardosogs`'s [athena-boilerplate](https://github.com/mateuscardosogs/athena-boilerplate), best regards for their contributions.

## Cookiecutter

Cookiecutter is a CLI tool (Command Line Interface) to create an application boilerplate from a template. It uses a templating system — Jinja2 — to replace or customize folder and file names, as well as file content.

### How can I install?

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

### How can I generate a `ai-dat` project?

```bash
cookiecutter gh:viniciusnvcosta/ai-dat
```
